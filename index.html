        <ul>
            <li >Verse 1: I can't wait to see your brilliant face<br>
                Light up the room around the pillowcase<br>
                She said, can you come over to my LA place<br>
                I got something to tell and it just can't wait<br>
                When I showed up, you held the doors in tears<br>
                Sat on the couch under the chandelier<br>
                You said you're having a baby, and before I could cry<br>
                You're leaving me just when I though you were mine<br>
            </li>
            <li>Pre-chorus: But I don't see your face, taken by the one hearted race<br>
                Home now, don't tell your other man<br>
                I got a hell of a plan<br>
            </li>
            <li>Chorus: Failing lights<br>
                Amass one hundred sleepless nights<br>
                And I might be holding on too tight<br>
                But there is a beast in my heart and he won't you leave alive<br>
            </li>
            <li>Verse 2: Nightmares<br>
                No longer wait for sleep (no)<br>
                Crawl on the ground up your hands and knees<br>
                Just like a lion and you're the queen of the pride<br>
                And we will feast together 'til the bones are dry<br>
            </li>
            <li>Pre-chorus: But I don't see your face (oh no), taken by the one hearted race<br>
                Oh now, don't tell your other man<br>
                He's not part of the plan<br>
            </li>
            <li>Bridge: Do you still love me? I am dying to know<br>
                Or did you forget what we shared<br>
                Out of sight out of mind I was never even there<br>
            </li>
            <li>Chorus: Failing lights<br>
                Amass one hundred sleepless nights<br>
                And I might be holding on too tight<br>
                But there is a beast in my heart and he won't you leave alive<br>
            </li>
            <li>Outro: This is the price you'll pay<br>
                Thoughts in your head that will never leave<br>

                So don't you forget what we had<br>
                It's like I was never even there<br>

                Go!<br>
            </li>
